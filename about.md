<p>I am a 21 year old passionate Android Application Developer based in Bengaluru, India.
I have been steadily engaged in the android development cycle since API 19 (Kitkat). I have 
a zeal for innovating application architecture, designing and building network data flow models
and scripting. </p>

<p>Apart from Android, I have also spent moderate amount of time coding on NodeJs,
Java, Python and Javascript, revolving around the field of Artificial Intelligence, Web
and Cloud Technologies.</p>
<p>
Being part of reputed communities like Association for Computing
Machinery, VIT Student Chapter and Google Developer Group, VIT Vellore, I have been
exposed to endless possibilities and innovation that we can achieve using technology.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am working as an Android Developer at Tapzo, Coraza technologies since January 2018.
